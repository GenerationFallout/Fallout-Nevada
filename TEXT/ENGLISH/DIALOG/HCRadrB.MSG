{100}{}{You see a guest.}
{101}{}{You see a passing trader. Now he is resting from the road and gaining strength for a long journey.}
{102}{}{Thank you for your help}

{110}{}{Yes? What do you want?}
{111}{}{Just to chat if you don't mind.}
{112}{}{Nothing. Just wrong door.}
{113}{}{This, of course, is great, but I would like to rest from the road and after all this turmoil. You know, sometimes you have to run around the city in order to sort things out. And then my wallet was stolen! Thieves can't let you breathe.}
{114}{}{Your wallet was stolen? Tell me more about it.}
{115}{}{Then I will not interfere with your melancholy. Goodbye.}
{116}{}{It was an old leather purse with a pile of papers and notes. There was no money there. The last time I used it was in the caravaneers' office. Then he returned here, and the purse was gone! I really do not know who could have rob me on this short path.}
{117}{}{So, on the path from the caravaneers to the hotel... I'll remember it.}
{118}{}{If you find it, I'll pay.}
{119}{}{Good.}
{120}{}{Yes?}
{121}{}{Tell me again about stolen wallet.}
{122}{}{Nothing, nevermind.}
{123}{}{Your purse was found. Don't ask where. I have my own professional secrets.}
{124}{}{Phew, what a relief! If it wasn't found, you can't even imagine how much time and effort I'd spent on the papers' restoration. Thanks a bunch. I promised you a reward. Here's 100$ for the finding.}
{125}{}{You don't need to pay. Taking rewards for other's belongings isn't really fair.}
{126}{}{You're welcome. Be careful in this town. Now I need to go.}
{127}{}{You're a wonderful person! Thank you again.}
{128}{}{You're welcome. Be careful in this town. Now I need to go.}
