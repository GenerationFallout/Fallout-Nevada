{101}{}{You examine the water tank and discover some muddy rainwater in it. Looks like that's what the raiders drink when they can't find anything stronger. They all must be suffering from flux. And if you spoil the water any further it may actually become fatal even for them.}
{102}{}{Leave.}
{103}{}{ You have some poison in your possession, but it's not enough for such an amount of water.}
{104}{}{ You have enough poison to lethally intoxicate all the raiders.}
{105}{}{Release poison into the water tank.}
{106}{}{You've released deadly poison into the water tank. Now everyone who drinks this water will die... Or so you hope. You should check back in a day or so to verify this theory.}

{108}{}{Water is still undrinkable.}
{109}{}{You examine the water tank and discover some muddy rainwater in it. Looks like that's what the raiders drank when they couldn't find anything stronger. They all must have suffered from flux.}
{110}{}{The water is still poisoned.}
{111}{}{One dose of poison won't be enough, you'll need at least two more. [Leave]}

{113}{}{Looks like the poison acted violently. The raiders are dead! And looks like their death was nothing like gentle and easy.}

{114}{}{Not during combat!}
{115}{}{Raiders used to drink this muddy water. Now it's unneeded.}
{116}{}{The water is poisoned.}
